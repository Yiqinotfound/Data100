    "Define a function `integer_distribution` that takes an array of integers and draws the histogram of the distribution using unit bins centered at the integers and white edges for the bars. The histogram should be drawn to the density scale. The left-most bar should be centered at the smallest integer in the array, and the right-most bar at the largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function does not have to check that the input is an array consisting only of integers. The display does not need to include the printed proportions and bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have trouble defining the function, go back and carefully read all the lines of code that resulted in the probability histogram of the number of spots on one roll of a die. Pay special attention to the bins. \n",

    "### Question 3b ###\n",
    "(Note: You can complete this part with just prerequisite knowledge for Data 100. That being said, Lecture 2 provides additional historical context and definitions for probability sample, sampling bias, and chance error).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to use probability samples is to quantify sampling bias and chance error. Put briefly, if we assume that a sample distribution was selected at random from a known population, then we can quantify how likely that sample is to have arisen due to random chance (**chance error**). If the difference in sample and population distributions is too great, then we suspect that the given sample has **bias** in how it was selected from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see this process in a *post*-analysis of *pre*-election polling of the 1936 U.S. Presidential Election. Through the U.S. electoral college process (we'll ignore it in this question, but read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College)), Franklin D. Roosevelt won the election by an overwhelming margin. The popular vote results were approximately 61% Roosevelt (Democrat, incumbent), 37% Alf Landon (Republican), and 2% other candidates. For this problem, this is our **population distribution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `np.random.multinomial` to simulate drawing at random with replacement from a categorical distribution. The arguments are the sample size `n` and an array `pvals` of the proportions in all the categories. The function simulates `n` independent random draws from the distribution and returns the observed counts in all the categories. Read the documentation to see how this is described formally; we will use the formal terminology and notation in future assignments after we have discussed them in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the function also takes a third argument `size`, which for our purposes will be an integer that specifies the number of times to run the entire simulation. All the runs are independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write one line of code that uses `np.random.multinomial` to run 10 independent simulations of drawing 100 times at random with replacement from a population in which 61% of the people vote for Roosevelt, 37% for Landon, and 2% for other candidatdes. The output should be an array containing the counts in the **Roosevelt** category in the 10 simulations. It will help to recall how to slice `NumPy` arrays. Assign your answer to the variable `sample`.\n",

    "After you have drawn the histogram, you might want to take a moment to recall the conclusion reached by the *Literary Digest*, a magazine that---while having successfully predicted the outcome of many previous presidential elections---failed to correctly predict the winner of the 1936 presidential election. In their survey of 10 million individuals, they predicted the popular vote as just 43% for Roosevelt and 57% for Landon. Based on our simulation, there was most definitely sampling bias in the *Digest*'s sampling process.\n",

You just have to call `plt.plot` after `integer_distribution`. Use `np.e` for $e$. For the curve, use 2 as the line width, and any color that is easy to see over the blue histogram. It's fine to just let Python use its default color.\n",

    "## Question 4: Linear Algebra ##\n",
    "A common representation of data uses matrices and vectors, so it is helpful to familiarize ourselves with linear algebra notation, as well as some simple operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a vector $\\vec{v}$ to be a column vector. Then, the following properties hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $c\\vec{v}$ with $c$ some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, is equal to a new vector where every element in $c\\vec{v}$ is equal to the corresponding element in $\\vec{v}$ multiplied by $c$. For example, $2 \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     1 \\\\\n",
    "     2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     2 \\\\\n",
    "     4 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{v}_2$ is equal to a new vector with elements equal to the elementwise addition of $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$. For example, $\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     1 \\\\\n",
    "     2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     -3 \\\\\n",
    "     4 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    -2 \\\\\n",
    "     6 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above properties form our definition for a **linear combination** of vectors. $\\vec{v}_3$ is a linear combination of $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$ if $\\vec{v}_3 = a\\vec{v}_1 + b\\vec{v}_2$, where $a$ and $b$ are some constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, we stack column vectors to form a matrix. Define the **rank** of a matrix $A$ to be equal to the maximal number of linearly independent columns in $A$. A set of columns is **linearly independent** if no column can be written as a linear combination of any other column(s) within the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let $A$ be a matrix with 4 columns. If three of these columns are linearly independent, but the fourth can be written as a linear combination of the other three, then $\\text{rank}(A) = 3$."

    "* Given the above definition, the dot product is (1) a **scalar**, not another vector; and (2) only defined for two vectors of the same length.\n",
    "* **Note**: In this course we often opt for $x$ instead of $\\vec{x}$ to simplify notation; $x$ as a vector is inferred from its use in the dot product. Then $x_i$ is the $i$-th element of the vector $x$.\n",
    "* *Detail*: In this course, we prefer the notation $x^Ty$ to illustrate a dot product, defined as matrix multiplication of $x^T$ and $y$. In the literature you may also see $x \\cdot y$, but we avoid this notation since the dot ($\\cdot$) notation is occasionally used for scalar values.\n",
    "* *Detail*: The dot product is a special case of an inner product, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "\n",

    "     \\dots \\\\\n",
    "     x_n\n",
    "     \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "* The special vector $\\mathbb{1}$ is a **vector of ones**, whose length is defined by the vector operation in which it is used. So with $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, the dot product $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ implies that $\\mathbb{1}$ is an $n$-dimensional column vector where every element is $1$.\n",
    "* Because dot products produce scalars, the multiplication of two scalars $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ produces another scalar, $\\bar{x}$.\n",
    "* **Note**: We use bar notation for the mean ($\\bar{x}$ instead of $\\mu$) in this problem to differentiate $\\bar{x}$ from $\\bar{y}$, the latter of which is the mean of data $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) We can further use this definition of $\\bar{x}$ to additionally write the [**variance**](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/2/Variability.html#The-Rough-Size-of-Deviations-from-Average) $\\sigma_x^2$ of the data $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ as a dot product.

We'll dive into this later in the course.\n",

How convenient!!\n",
